    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      A healthy dish made by Senshi where a whole basilisk is stuffed with
      medicinal herbs then slowly spit-roasted over an open fire. It tastes much
      better if left overnight to rest after the spice rub and prior to
      stuffing, although if time is of the essence it can be cooked immediately.
    </p>

      <li>1 Basilisk</li>
      <li>Mana herb, to taste</li>

        Remove the tail and feet of the Basilisk. Blanch it a bit and pluck its
        feathers. Take its innards out and rub your spices on it. Stuff it with
        veggies and finely chopped herbs and tie up the opening.
      </li>
