    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      A tart-like dish created by Senshi from the fruit of different Man-eating
      Plants. Described as salty by the group, it is likely to be more akin to a
      quiche but with an inedible shell. A mixture of mashed up and cut up
      Man-eating Plant fruit, slime, and scorpion soup is poured into a pan
      lined with the flattened peel of the fruit and cooked before garnishing
      with some more fruit.

        Steam the fruit lightly. Cut around the stem in a circle, twist the stem
        and pull away to remove the seeds. Peel the skin off, beat to make it
        soft, and cover the frying pan with it.
      </li>
      <li>
        Grind up the unripe fruit, adding Slime and some scorpion broth, mixing
        until it thickens. Once it gets smooth, add the rest of the scorpion
        broth and chunks of tree fruit and mix.
      </li>
      <li>Pour the mixture into the frying pan and cook.</li>
      <li>Once it starts bubbling, add the rest of the fruit on top.</li>
